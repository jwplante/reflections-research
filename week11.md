For this week, I read a study by Yoghourdjian et. al., “Scalability of Network Visualisation from a Cognitive Load Perspective”. I mainly was interested in this paper since it had to do with network graphs, a type of visualization that I wanted to learn more about since I missed class on Monday and EEG, which I had learned about through my research this year at the WPI HCI Lab. The purpose of the study was to figure out at what scale node-edge network visualizations become cognitively taxing and cause users to inaccurately analyze the graph. Additionally, the study aimed to highlight which areas of the brain had more activity when under a high cognitive load. In the study, participants were given many graphs to find the shortest paths to between nodes with varying number of nodes and density of nodes. According to the background in the paper, while studies have used large graphs, the information that users were given was a summary of the data as opposed to having the user having to mentally parse the network, enhancing the novelty of the study. Physiological data collected not only included EEG data but also other responses such as eye dilation and heart rate.

While I understand some of the research questions needed to be assessed in terms of a study, a lot of their findings seem intuitive to me. They found that as there are more nodes and in greater density, users had much more difficulty finding the shortest path. However, what I found especially interesting was that between the easy and hard tasks, users used different areas of the brain: in the hard tasks, there was a greater activation of the left parieto-occipital region of the brain, which according to the paper is associated with pattern recognition and memory. I also found it interesting that they tried to make a model for which properties of the graphs could lead to the increased cognitive load.
