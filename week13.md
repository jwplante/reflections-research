This week, I tried to find a paper that was related to my final project, but I struggled to find much on geological visualization relating
to travel patterns: while it seems like a relevant issue considering current events, there does not appear to be a lot of information on 
specific visualization techniques. Therefore, I decided to read a paper introducing four topics that are underexplored in data visualization: "Reaching Broader Audiences With Data Visualization".
The first topic that Lee et al. discussed was about Personal Informatics, essentially the field concerning collection of data of individuals from devices, and
how in that field, the primary audience to benefit might not be as informed about visualization techniques. Afterwards, Lee et al. discuss
how data visualization in mobile devices may not be able to inherit the assumptions that are afforded on desktop computers due to the difference
in input method, context of usage, and the impacts of having smaller and varying sized screens. The authors then went into a discussion regarding
the difficulties that users with disablilities (such as low vision or disabilities relating to mental processing) and how there has been some
research in regards to data physicalization, or creating "physical representations" of the data such as using 3-D printers. Finally, the authors
discussed how there needs to be different methods of visualization due to different ways of interaction (such as through voice).

I thought this article was very informative on topics of visualization I was not familiar with. As a person who does not have the best eyesight, I
was surprised they did not go into detail about the problem of the potential design decisions that could be made for people that are not completely blind
but struggle with reading text in visualizations due to contrast issues, etc. Overall, I thought it was a good outline about emerging topics in
data visualization and may be exploring some of these topics in future reflections.
