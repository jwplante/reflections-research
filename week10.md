NOTE: I have already told Professor Harrison that I will be submitting this reflection late and will be presenting this paper
in week 11.

Last week, I decided to read the paper "Data Comics for Reporting Controlled User Studies in Human-Computer Interaction" since I found
the idea of combining HCI techniques such as storyboarding with data visualization in a new and unique way. The paper presents the idea
and principles of a "data comic", a summary of a study using data visualizations in a comic format. During this study, the authors and outside researchers 
created their own data comics from studies that they knew well, creating a set of design guidelines, then tested it by giving those design 
guidelines to people in aid of them making data comics. 

Personally, I like this idea of creating a data comic a lot because it can be hard to parse a 10-15 page long research paper especially when you
are just starting to get into research. I believe that it would lower the barrier for researchers as well as creating a more personable way to 
summarize information compared to an abstract, poster or an infographic. Some of the participants of the study had an interesting point about 
the reproducability of these data comics, since you could use them in many venues such as presenting in conferences, as a teaching aid,
as an academic poster, etc.
